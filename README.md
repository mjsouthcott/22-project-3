## User Story

```
AS A operator, when my vehicle breaks down,
I WANT the ability to create and submit a repair request remotely
IN ORDER TO minimize maintainer response time and improve efficiency.
Include location information
Allow operators to attach photos of faults to repair requests


AS A maintenance manager,
I WANT the ability to receive repair requests remotely, create work orders, allocate resources (technicians and vehicles) to them, and dispatch those resources to worksites
IN ORDER TO minimize repair times.
I ALSO WANT the ability to view work progress and completion statistics (graph and map views)
IN ORDER TO better manage resources.


AS A technician,
I WANT the ability to create, complete and submit inspection and repair work orders at the repair site
IN ORDER TO track work completion.
